# EOS_DLL
My attempt to make a EOS Emulator.
Because I'm not good at C/C++ I wrote this in C# and use DNNE to create a simple middleware between the generated C/C++ and the C# version.

# Dependecy
This depends on .NET 8.
You also must have a c++ builder (GCC, MSVC)
Nuget Dependencies:
- JWT
- Newtonsoft.Json
- L (LLibrary - for logs)
- DNNE
